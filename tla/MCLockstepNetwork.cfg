\* Model checker configuration for LockstepNetwork.tla
\* Extended model with ICE restart, partitions, and connection flapping

CONSTANT Peer = {1, 2, 3}

CONSTANT MaxFlaps = 2

INVARIANT TypeInvariant
INVARIANT ConnectedFrameBoundedDrift

INVARIANT NoSelfPartition

\* Note: FlappingPeersBackedOff is not checked as invariant because
\* it's a behavioral property (peers CAN be in connecting state when flapping)
