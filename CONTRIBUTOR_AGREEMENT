Astranyx Contributor License Agreement

By submitting a Contribution (including pull requests, patches, or any other
submission) to Astranyx or any software owned by Astranyx Owner, you
automatically agree to these terms. This applies only to Contributions, not to
using the software, reporting issues, or forking.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means any original work or context (code, documentation,
configuration, assets, art, music, etc.) you intentionally submit for inclusion
in the Astranyx project.

"You" means the copyright owner or entity authorized to submit the Contribution.
For legal entities, all controlled entities are considered a single Contributor.

2. GRANTS

You grant Astranyx Owner:

a) Copyright: Perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable
   license to reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense, and distribute
   your Contribution.

b) Patent: For patents necessarily infringed by your Contribution, a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to make, use,
   sell, and import your Contribution. This terminates if you initiate patent
   litigation against Astranyx Owner related to the Contribution.

c) Relicensing: License to include your Contribution in future versions under
   different license terms.

You retain all ownership rights. These grants do not restrict your rights.

3. REPRESENTATIONS

You represent that:

a) You are legally entitled to grant these licenses. If your employer has
   rights to your work, you have obtained permission or waiver.

b) Your Contribution is your original creation. (Submit non-original work
   separately, marked "Third-party: [source]" with complete details
   of source and restrictions.)

c) You will disclose any third-party licenses, patents, or restrictions
   associated with your Contribution.

d) You will notify Astranyx Owner if any representation becomes inaccurate.

4. NO WARRANTY

You provide Contributions "AS IS" without warranties of any kind.
