description: Deep assessment with complex refactor ideas (project)
---

Review the recent changes in the thread holistically with a focus on deeper opportunities and complex refactor ideas.

Make a plan to refactor/explore:
- Deeper architectural improvements
- Consolidate code
- Fix implementation inconsistencies
- Fix anything hacky/bloated/redundant
- DRY up code / extract out a common component (do NOT go overboard)
- Remove dead/unused/obsolete code
- Add missing test coverage
- Focus on deeper architectural improvements
- Complex refactoring opportunities
- Advanced patterns and abstractions
- Significant code consolidation opportunities
- Major technical debt items

Write and save the plan summary to the `lore` folder (NOT project root) in Markdown format, filename: "%Y%m%d-%H%M-lowercase-name.md" (include leading zero of %m/%d/%H/etc)
