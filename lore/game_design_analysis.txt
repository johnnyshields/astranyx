Key Pattern: Information + deduction -> correct action

================================================================================
                    PART 2: LATENT SPACE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Six key dimensions emerged that appear to correlate with "fun" in game rules:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AXIS 1: ENTROPY MANAGEMENT (Order <-> Chaos)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scale: Deterministic Logic | Random Inputs You Organize | Pure Chaos

- Low entropy (ordered): Minesweeper, Sokoban
  * All information available, purely logical
  * Satisfaction from perfect deduction

- Managed entropy (sweet spot): Tetris, Puyo Puyo
  * Random inputs that player must organize
  * Satisfaction from imposing order on chaos

- High entropy (chaotic): Pure slot machines
  * No player agency in outcomes
  * Generally NOT fun (gambling, not gaming)

FUN INSIGHT: The most engaging games introduce randomness that skilled players
can "tame" but never fully control. Complete determinism feels like work;
complete randomness feels unfair.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AXIS 2: PRESSURE TYPE (Time vs Space vs Self-Imposed)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Time Pressure: Tetris pieces fall, Space Invaders descend
  * Creates urgency
  * Forces decisions before optimal analysis

- Space Pressure: Snake grows, Pac-Man safe zones shrink
  * Past success creates future difficulty
  * Elegant self-balancing mechanism

- Self-Imposed: Bejeweled (untimed), Minesweeper
  * Player controls pace
  * Tension from risk, not timer

FUN INSIGHT: External pressure (especially time) creates engagement without
blame. The game "made you rush" - failure feels acceptable, success feels earned.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AXIS 3: CASCADE POTENTIAL (Linear <-> Exponential)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Linear: Space Invaders (1 shot = 1 kill)
  * Consistent, predictable rewards
  * Satisfaction from efficiency

- Exponential: Puyo Puyo chains, Bejeweled cascades
  * Small setup -> massive payoff
  * "Big brain" moments create memorable peaks

FUN INSIGHT: Disproportionate rewards for clever play create stories worth
sharing and moments worth chasing. The POSSIBILITY of a huge cascade is often
more motivating than the cascade itself.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AXIS 4: STATE VISIBILITY (Complete <-> Hidden)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Complete Information: Chess puzzles, Sokoban
  * All data visible
  * Pure reasoning challenge

- Hidden Information: Minesweeper, Tetris next pieces
  * Must plan around uncertainty
  * Creates anticipation and adaptation

FUN INSIGHT: Partial information creates two types of engagement:
1. Anticipation (what's coming?)
2. Adaptation (plans must change)

The preview piece in Tetris transformed the game from frustrating to strategic.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AXIS 5: REVERSIBILITY (Permanent <-> Correctable)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Permanent: Tetris placements, Minesweeper clicks
  * High stakes per action
  * Mistakes feel consequential

- Correctable: Bejeweled swaps, Undo buttons
  * Lower stakes per action
  * Experimentation encouraged

FUN INSIGHT: For actions to feel meaningful, some should be irreversible.
BUT - and this is critical - mistakes must feel like YOUR FAULT.
Games with permanent consequences need clear causation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AXIS 6: GOAL CLARITY (Explicit <-> Emergent)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Explicit: "Clear all dots", "Destroy all bricks"
  * Clear progress indication
  * Satisfaction from completion

- Emergent: "Survive as long as possible", "Maximize score"
  * No clear endpoint
  * Mastery-driven satisfaction

FUN INSIGHT: Clear goals enable flow state (you know what to do).
Emergent goals enable mastery pursuit (there's always improvement).
Best games often have BOTH: explicit short-term, emergent long-term.

================================================================================
                    PART 3: THE "FUN" FORMULA
================================================================================

Games that score highest on player enjoyment typically combine:

1. RANDOMNESS YOU CAN TAME
   - Not pure luck, not pure skill
   - Player agency within constraints
   - "I could have done better" feeling

2. CASCADING REWARDS
   - Small inputs can create big outputs
   - Skill/planning enables disproportionate results
   - Creates memorable peak moments

3. CLEAR FAILURE ATTRIBUTION
   - When you lose, you understand why
   - No "that was unfair" feeling
   - Encourages retry behavior

4. INCREASING PRESSURE
   - Difficulty scales with success
   - Self-balancing difficulty curve
   - Prevents both boredom and frustration

5. SIMPLE RULES, EMERGENT COMPLEXITY
   - Easy to learn (low barrier)
   - Hard to master (high ceiling)
   - Rules fit in one sentence, strategy fills books

================================================================================
                    PART 4: NEW GAME DESIGN
================================================================================

GAME: CHROMATIC COLLAPSE
------------------------

Based on the latent space analysis, we designed a game that optimizes each axis:

CORE CONCEPT:
You control a "color absorber" that moves around a grid. Colored orbs spawn
randomly and slowly expand. You absorb orbs to charge your color energy.
When you release energy of a color, all orbs of that color collapse and
chain-react.

HOW IT MAPS TO THE LATENT SPACE:

| Axis                | Implementation                                      |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Entropy Management  | Random orb spawns you must manage into order        |
| Pressure Type       | Time (orbs expand) + Space (grid fills up)          |
| Cascade Potential   | Releasing color collapses ALL orbs of that color    |
| State Visibility    | Full grid visible, spawn locations unpredictable    |
| Reversibility       | Movement free, collapse permanent                   |
| Goal Clarity        | Explicit: survive / Emergent: maximize score        |

RULE SYNTHESIS:
- From Tetris: Random elements you must organize, time pressure
- From Puyo Puyo: Color matching, chain reactions, combo multipliers
- From Pac-Man: Grid navigation, consumption mechanics
- From Space Invaders: Threat expansion, edge danger
- From Snake: Success (absorbing) creates future challenges

EXPECTED "FUN" PROFILE:
- Accessible (simple movement + 4 action buttons)
- Strategic (when to absorb vs when to release)
- Satisfying (color collapse particle effects, combo system)
- Replayable (randomness ensures different games)
- Skill-rewarding (better play = higher combos)
