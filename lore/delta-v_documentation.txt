                               GAME MECHANICS
================================================================================

LIVES SYSTEM:
  - Each player starts with 3 lives
  - On death, respawn after 2 seconds (if lives remain)
  - Respawn grants 3 seconds invincibility
  - Ship level and weapon powerups are retained on respawn
  - Orbs and drones are lost on death
  - Game over when all players reach 0 lives

SHIELDS:
  - Starting shields: 100
  - Max shields increase with ship upgrades (+25 per level)
  - Shield powerups restore 35 shields
  - Orbs can absorb hits (destroyed instead of taking damage)

PHYSICS:
  - Ships have momentum and inertia
  - Slight gravity pulls ships downward
  - Shooting causes recoil (pushes ship backward)
  - Players cannot overlap (collision pushes apart)

SCORING:
  - Points awarded for destroying enemies
  - Multiplier increases with kills (max 8x)
  - Multiplier slowly decays over time
