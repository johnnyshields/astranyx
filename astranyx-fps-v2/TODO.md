- Add jump cooldown and jump queuing (queue jump if space tapped during cooldown)
- Fix: tap C to crouch, then hold C and release doesn't stand up (same issue in prone)
- Fix tap vs hold detection timing (frame rate issue)
- Lockstep should sync actual stance, not button presses (make stance local)
- Strafing obliquely into walls (<10 deg) should slide along wall, not get stuck
- Add subtle camera bob while moving (different for walk/run/crouch/prone), zeroes when stopped - affects camera only, not player position
- Climbing ladder
- Wading in water
- Floating at water surface
- Diving/swimming underwater
- Cover at wall corner / peeking / leaning
- Definitively fix can't stand issues (collision detection)
- Add PBR textures to walls/floor (albedo, normal, roughness, metallic, ao)
- Implement ParallaxPhysicalMaterial with height map support
- Add height_texture fields to PhysicalMaterial struct in three-d fork
- Update enum_bitfield macro call for height_texture
- Add POM shader code to physical_material.frag
- Update fragment_shader_source() and use_uniforms()
- Update Astranyx Cargo.toml to use local three-d fork
